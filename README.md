This repository contains a practice exercise for multiclass classification using logistic regression. The goal is to predict the species of Iris flowers using the famous Iris Flower dataset available in the scikit-learn library.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this exercise is the Iris Flower dataset, which is included in the scikit-learn library. It is a popular dataset for practicing machine learning classification tasks. The dataset consists of 150 samples, each representing a different Iris flower. For each sample, four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) are provided, along with the corresponding species label (setosa, versicolor, or virginica).

## Dependencies

To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3
- scikit-learn

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```shell
pip install scikit-learn
